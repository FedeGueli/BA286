We assembled a set 280 BA.2 (Nextstrain clade 21L) sequences collected between November 2021 and June 2022 from data deposited on GISAID [GISAIDRef]. BA.2.86 sequences were downloaded on September 7 2023 directly from GISAID. We excluded sequences with reversion mutations relative to BA.2, sequences flagged as poor quality by Nextclade [Aksamentov], or sequences with less than 90% coverage of the reference. Sequences were pairwise aligned against Wuhan-Hu-1 using Nextclade. Terminals and gaps were masked as well as all suspected artefactual reversions to reference in BA.2.86 sequences. A tree was built using IQ-tree 2 and postprocessed using a custom script to correct for incomplete merging of branches in large polytomies.

A time tree was inferred using TreeTime using a clock rate of 0.0005 per site and year [Neher 2022]. The rate of the long branch between BA.2 and BA.2.86 was set to be 2 times the rate of the rest of the tree in line with previous observation that evolution is 2-fold accelerated along many long branches leading to distinct clades [Neher (2022)]. This acceleration is consistent with the dramatic enrichment of amino acid substitutions in the spike protein along the long branch leading to BA.2.86.

The phylogenetic workflow was implemented with snakemake using the augur [Huddleston et a] toolchain and is available at github.com/neherlab/BA286. The repo contains a specific list of sites  (config/mask.tsv) that are masked in individual sequences.
